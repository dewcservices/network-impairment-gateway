    Consumer Satellite Profile
    Consumer satellite connections, such as those provided by HughesNet or Viasat, generally have higher latency than
    terrestrial connections due to geostationary orbit, and bandwidth is often shared among users, leading to lower speeds during peak times.
    -----------------------------------
    Bandwidth: 25 Mbps (downlink), 3 Mbps (uplink) â€” typical for consumer satellite plans.
    Latency: 600ms (due to geostationary orbit).
    Jitter: 50ms (due to network congestion and signal variation).
    Packet Loss: 3% (common in consumer satellite services due to shared bandwidth and interference).
